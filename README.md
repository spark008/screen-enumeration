# Screen Enumeration API Proposal

This proposal describes an API that exposes a list of the displays connected to
a device, and a subset of properties for each display. Access to this data would
enable or enhance a variety of window placement capabilities described in the
[Window Placement API proposal](https://github.com/spark008/window-placement/blob/master/README.md).
