# Screen Enumeration on the web

This repository considers web platform functionality for multi-screen devices.
The goals here are to elucidate some uses, limitations, and proposals for web
technology on multi-screen devices. Screen Enumeration concerns the current
fundamental inability of web platform users to discern the overall visual bounds
available for displaying content.

Please see the
[Explainer](https://github.com/spark008/screen-enumeration/blob/master/EXPLAINER.md)
and [W3C Security and Privacy Self-Review Questionnaire response](https://github.com/spark008/screen-enumeration/blob/master/security_and_privacy.md)
documents for a deeper dive into this topic. File issues here, reply to our
[W3C WICG Discourse posting](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-supporting-window-placement-on-multi-screen-devices/3948),
or reach out as you see fit with feedback, relevant use cases, and thoughts.

Please also take a look at the related
[Window Placement API proposal](https://github.com/spark008/window-placement/blob/master/README.md),
which considers a similar set of topics regarding the creation and movement of
windows on multi-screen devices.
